v0.1.1 fix label hover issue

	A workaround can be a combination of
		1, Setting a class hover (or whatever name) as well as the selector :hover in the CSS.
		2, Calling .addClass("hover") to trigger CSS, and .trigger("hover") or .trigger("mouseenter") to trigger the JS.
		3, Ensuring the mouseleave handler. or 2nd .hover() handler, clears the hover class if present.
